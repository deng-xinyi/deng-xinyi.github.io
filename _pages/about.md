I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Data Science at Beijing University of Technology. Previously, I was a postdoctoral research scientist in Dr. Liam Paninski's group in the [Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University's Zuckerman Institute of Mind Brain Behavior.


Education & Training
------
Throughout my academic training, I have been blessed with outstanding mentors. I did my undergraduate senior project on functional mixed effects models for longitudinal data with [Dr. Elizabeth Malloy](https://www.american.edu/cas/faculty/malloy.cfm), who introduced me to statistical research and strongly encouraged me to apply to PhD programs. My doctoral thesis advisor was [Dr. Uri Eden](http://www.bu.edu/math/people/faculty/probability-and-statistics/eden/), a brilliant statistician and an engaging teacher at once, who inspired and supported me to continue on the academic career path. During my PhD, I started a collaboration with [Dr. Loren Frank](https://www.cin.ucsf.edu/HTML/Loren_Frank.html) and his lab, who taught me that, besides all things brain, doing good science is a fulfilling and joyous thing. I have been working at the intersection of statistics and neuroscience ever since.
