I am a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University's [Zuckerman Institute](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/) of Mind Brain Behavior.


Education & Training
------
Throughout my academic training, I have been blessed with outstanding mentors, people who have illuminated so many aspects of creativity for me with their intellectual power, expertise as scientists, and qualities as human beings. 

I did my undergraduate senior project on functional mixed effects model for longitudinal data with [Dr. Elizabeth Malloy](https://www.american.edu/cas/faculty/malloy.cfm), who introduced me to statistical research and strongly encouraged me to apply to PhD programs. My doctorate thesis advisor was [Dr. Uri Eden](http://www.bu.edu/math/people/faculty/probability-and-statistics/eden/), whose dedication to his craft inspired me to continue on the academic career path. During my PhD, I also started a collaboration with [Dr. Loren Frank](https://physiology.ucsf.edu/content/loren-frank-phd) and his lab, which taught me, besides all things brain, doing good science is a fulfilling and joyous thing. And I have been working at the intersection of statistics and neuroscience ever since.
